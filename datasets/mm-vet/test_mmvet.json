        "question": "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?",
        "answer": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

        "question": "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?",
        "answer": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

        "answer": "It is crown gall, a common plant disease caused by the soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

        "answer": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

        "question": "The pie charts below show units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words.",
        "answer": "The pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\nTotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\nCoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country\u2019s electricity.\n\nAustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source in France, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.",

        "answer": "The Arnolfini Portrait (or The Arnolfini Wedding, The Arnolfini Marriage, the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, or other titles) is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

        "question": "Chorleywood is a village near London whose population has increased steadily since the middle of the nineteenth century. The map below shows the development of the village.\n\nWrite a report for a university lecturer describing the development of the village. \n\nYou should write at least 150 words.",
        "answer": "The map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994.\n\nIt is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",
